# Rainwater Retention

## Description

This project contains a Python script that calculates the total amount of rainwater retained between walls represented by a list of non-negative integers. Each integer represents the height of a wall, and the unit width of each wall is assumed to be 1. The script uses an efficient two-pointer technique to compute the water retention.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains. Assume that the ends of the list are not walls, meaning they will not retain water. 

### Example

- For the input list `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]`, the output will be `6`.
- For the input list `[2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]`, the output will also be `6`.
